  <h1>Privacy Policy – </h1>

  <p>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how <strong></strong> (“Application”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) processes personal data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable German data protection laws. Please read this document carefully.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
  <p>
    The data controller responsible for this Application is:<br>
    <strong>Tim Weber</strong><br>
    [Ayrerstr. 3 90480 Nürnberg]<br>
    Email: [timweberj@gmail.com]
  </p>

  <h2>2. Purpose and Scope</h2>
  <p>
    The Application is developed to help YouTube channel managers automate routine metadata updates and playlist management tasks. It uses the YouTube Data API to interact with YouTube video data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> The Application is designed to work with your own YouTube account only. No third-party user data is collected, stored, or shared. Only publicly available data is used to provide the functionality of the Application.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Processing</h2>
  <p>
    The Application does not actively collect or store any personal data from users beyond what is publicly available from YouTube for your own account. All data processing activities are limited to enabling the features of the Application for channel management.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
  <p>
    The processing of data in connection with the Application is based on the legitimate interests of the data controller in efficiently managing their YouTube channel. As no additional personal data is processed, the risks to data subjects are minimal.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take the security of your data seriously. All API communications are encrypted and we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent unauthorized access.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Under the GDPR, you have rights regarding access, rectification, or deletion of your personal data. However, since the Application does not collect personal data from third parties, these rights are not applicable here. If you have any questions concerning data protection, please contact us using the information provided above.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be posted on this page and will become effective immediately upon posting. Please review this page periodically.
